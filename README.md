## Module 1 Capstone: Vending Machine command line application 

Partner project showcasing OOP principles. 
Each instance of the vending machine is stocked via `vendingmachine.csv`, then initializes a display menu for the user to input money, make their selection, and end their transaction. Actions are logged in `Log.txt`, and the inventory loaded from the csv are updated.
